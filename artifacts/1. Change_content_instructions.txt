  <h1>Hi, I’m Nikhil Kapahi — welcome to The Inner Scorecard!</h1>
  <p>By day I’m a senior scientist at Amazon, an investor, and an entrepreneur. Outside of work, I’m passionate about mindfulness and meditation—and I recently took on my most rewarding adventure yet: becoming a new dad.</p>
  <p>I created The Inner Scorecard because I believe real success comes from within, measured by our own values rather than external validation. On this podcast, I share candid conversations about wins, failures, and everything in between—with inspiring guests and personal reflections as we explore what success truly looks like.</p>
