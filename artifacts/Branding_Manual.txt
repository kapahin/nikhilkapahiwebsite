🎨 1. Visual & Design Consistency
Font usage

Always use Roboto (regular/light/medium/bold as needed) when generating any visuals, slides, banners, or mockups.

Prioritize legibility and modern simplicity.

Color palette
Use only the following hex codes wherever visuals are generated:

Black – #000000

Tangerine – #E9A45A

Coral Red – #C66358

Plum – #76405F

Deep Indigo – #2C0D84

White – #FFFFFF

Tip: For backgrounds, prefer dark gradient backgrounds like shown in samples (indigo/plum fading to black).

Background style

Emulate the subtle, moody gradient look you provided: deep blues/purples fading softly to black. Avoid flat or overly bright backgrounds.

✍️ 2. Tone & Language Style
Tone

Professional yet warm and approachable.

Confident, concise, and insightful.

Avoid clichés; be authentic.

Voice

Use clear, crisp phrasing.

Inject occasional subtle enthusiasm.

Tailor phrasing to an audience interested in personal development, productivity, tech, and clarity.

Structure

Prefer bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.

Keep paragraphs short and focused.

Use bolding sparingly to highlight key insights or action items.

🧩 3. Content & Purpose Guidelines
Core values to reference

Self-awareness

Continuous growth

Balanced productivity

Recommended content types

Website copy (headlines, intro paragraphs)

Social posts (e.g., LinkedIn/X/Twitter snippets)

Podcast descriptions, email drafts

Visual mockups (e.g., banners, carousels)

Formatting & brand markers

Headlines in Roboto Bold, all caps or Title Case.

Body copy in Roboto Regular or Light.

Use primary brand color (#E9A45A) for highlights, CTAs, or emphasis.

📦 4. Brand Asset Usage
Always incorporate the gradient background in artwork unless explicitly requested otherwise.

For logos or other brand elements, follow the visual spacing and proportion from your samples.

When generating banners (e.g. X/Twitter, YouTube), emulate the layout exactly—bold white brand name (“THE INNER SCORECARD podcast”) centered against background.

🧊 5. Quality Control Checklist
When delivering any asset, run this final check:

Font used = Roboto

Colors limited to brand palette

Background = dark gradient (like sample)

Tone = confident, clear, approachable

Visual hierarchy = headline, sub‑text, CTA

General spacing and alignment replicate provided examples
